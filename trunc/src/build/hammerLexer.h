 *     -                 for the lexer : hammerLexerLexer *
 * Editing it, at least manually, is not wise.

 *
 * The lexer hammerLexerhas the callable functions (rules) shown below,
 * which will invoke the code for the associated rule in the source grammar
 * assuming that the input stream is pointing to a token/text stream that could begin
 * this rule.
 * 
 * For instance if you call the first (topmost) rule in a parser grammar, you will
 * get the results of a full parse, but calling a rule half way through the grammar will
 * allow you to pass part of a full token stream to the parser, such as for syntax checking
 * in editors and so on.
 *
 * The parser entry points are called indirectly (by function pointer to function) via
 * a parser context typedef phammerLexer, which is returned from a call to hammerLexerNew().
 *
 * As this is a generated lexer, it is unlikely you will call it 'manually'. However
 * the entry points are provided anyway.
 * * The entry points for hammerLexer are  as follows:
 *
 *  - void      phammerLexer->T8(phammerLexer)
 *  - void      phammerLexer->T9(phammerLexer)
 *  - void      phammerLexer->T10(phammerLexer)
 *  - void      phammerLexer->T11(phammerLexer)
 *  - void      phammerLexer->ID(phammerLexer)
 *  - void      phammerLexer->STRING(phammerLexer)
 *  - void      phammerLexer->COMMENT(phammerLexer)
 *  - void      phammerLexer->WS(phammerLexer)
 *  - void      phammerLexer->Tokens(phammerLexer)
 *
 * The return type for any particular rule is of course determined by the source
 * grammar file.
