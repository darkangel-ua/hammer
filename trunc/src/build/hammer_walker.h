 *
 * The tree parser hammer_walkerhas the callable functions (rules) shown below,
 * which will invoke the code for the associated rule in the source grammar
 * assuming that the input stream is pointing to a token/text stream that could begin
 * this rule.
 * 
 * For instance if you call the first (topmost) rule in a parser grammar, you will
 * get the results of a full parse, but calling a rule half way through the grammar will
 * allow you to pass part of a full token stream to the parser, such as for syntax checking
 * in editors and so on.
 *
 * The parser entry points are called indirectly (by function pointer to function) via
 * a parser context typedef phammer_walker, which is returned from a call to hammer_walkerNew().
 *
 * The entry points for hammer_walker are  as follows:
 *
 *  - void      phammer_walker->project(phammer_walker)
 *  - void      phammer_walker->rules(phammer_walker)
 *  - void      phammer_walker->rule(phammer_walker)
 *  - void      phammer_walker->args(phammer_walker)
 *  - void      phammer_walker->string_list(phammer_walker)
 *  - void      phammer_walker->string_list_id(phammer_walker)
 *  - void      phammer_walker->feature_list(phammer_walker)
 *  - void      phammer_walker->feature(phammer_walker)
 *  - void      phammer_walker->null_arg(phammer_walker)
 *
 * The return type for any particular rule is of course determined by the source
 * grammar file.
