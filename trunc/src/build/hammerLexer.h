/** \file
 *  This C header file was generated by $ANTLR version 3.1.1
 *
 *     -  From the grammar source file : hammer.g
 *     -                            On : 2008-10-22 23:24:19
 *     -                 for the lexer : hammerLexerLexer *
 * Editing it, at least manually, is not wise. 
 *
 * C language generator and runtime by Jim Idle, jimi|hereisanat|idle|dotgoeshere|ws.
 *
 *
 * The lexer hammerLexer has the callable functions (rules) shown below,
 * which will invoke the code for the associated rule in the source grammar
 * assuming that the input stream is pointing to a token/text stream that could begin
 * this rule.
 * 
 * For instance if you call the first (topmost) rule in a parser grammar, you will
 * get the results of a full parse, but calling a rule half way through the grammar will
 * allow you to pass part of a full token stream to the parser, such as for syntax checking
 * in editors and so on.
 *
 * The parser entry points are called indirectly (by function pointer to function) via
 * a parser context typedef phammerLexer, which is returned from a call to hammerLexerNew().
 *
 * As this is a generated lexer, it is unlikely you will call it 'manually'. However
 * the methods are provided anyway.
 * * The methods in phammerLexer are  as follows:
 *
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->T__28(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->T__29(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->T__30(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->T__31(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->T__32(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->T__33(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->SLASH(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->ID(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->COLON(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->STRING(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->STRING_ID(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->COMMENT(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->WS(phammerLexer)
 *  -  void      phammerLexer->Tokens(phammerLexer)
 *
 * The return type for any particular rule is of course determined by the source
 * grammar file.
