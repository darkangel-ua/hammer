/** \file
 *  This C header file was generated by $ANTLR version 3.1.1
 *
 *     -  From the grammar source file : hammer_sema.gt
 *     -                            On : 2010-07-30 18:32:32
 *     -           for the tree parser : hammer_semaTreeParser *
 * Editing it, at least manually, is not wise. 
 *
 * C language generator and runtime by Jim Idle, jimi|hereisanat|idle|dotgoeshere|ws.
 *
 *
 * The tree parser hammer_sema has the callable functions (rules) shown below,
 * which will invoke the code for the associated rule in the source grammar
 * assuming that the input stream is pointing to a token/text stream that could begin
 * this rule.
 * 
 * For instance if you call the first (topmost) rule in a parser grammar, you will
 * get the results of a full parse, but calling a rule half way through the grammar will
 * allow you to pass part of a full token stream to the parser, such as for syntax checking
 * in editors and so on.
 *
 * The parser entry points are called indirectly (by function pointer to function) via
 * a parser context typedef phammer_sema, which is returned from a call to hammer_semaNew().
 *
 * The methods in phammer_sema are  as follows:
 *
 *  - const hammer::ast::hamfile*      phammer_sema->hamfile(phammer_sema)
 *  - const hammer::ast::project_def*      phammer_sema->project_def(phammer_sema)
 *  - void      phammer_sema->arguments(phammer_sema)
 *  - const hammer::ast::expression*      phammer_sema->expression(phammer_sema)
 *  - void      phammer_sema->list_of(phammer_sema)
 *  - const hammer::ast::expression*      phammer_sema->list_of_impl(phammer_sema)
 *  - const hammer::ast::expression*      phammer_sema->path_like_seq(phammer_sema)
 *  - void      phammer_sema->path_like_seq_impl(phammer_sema)
 *
 * The return type for any particular rule is of course determined by the source
 * grammar file.
