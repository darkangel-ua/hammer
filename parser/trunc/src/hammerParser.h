/** \file
 *  This C header file was generated by $ANTLR version 3.1.1
 *
 *     -  From the grammar source file : hammer.g
 *     -                            On : 2010-06-27 18:46:25
 *     -                for the parser : hammerParserParser *
 * Editing it, at least manually, is not wise. 
 *
 * C language generator and runtime by Jim Idle, jimi|hereisanat|idle|dotgoeshere|ws.
 *
 *
 * The parser hammerParser has the callable functions (rules) shown below,
 * which will invoke the code for the associated rule in the source grammar
 * assuming that the input stream is pointing to a token/text stream that could begin
 * this rule.
 * 
 * For instance if you call the first (topmost) rule in a parser grammar, you will
 * get the results of a full parse, but calling a rule half way through the grammar will
 * allow you to pass part of a full token stream to the parser, such as for syntax checking
 * in editors and so on.
 *
 * The parser entry points are called indirectly (by function pointer to function) via
 * a parser context typedef phammerParser, which is returned from a call to hammerParserNew().
 *
 * The methods in phammerParser are  as follows:
 *
 *  - hammerParser_hamfile_return      phammerParser->hamfile(phammerParser)
 *  - hammerParser_project_def_return      phammerParser->project_def(phammerParser)
 *  - hammerParser_project_id_return      phammerParser->project_id(phammerParser)
 *
 * The return type for any particular rule is of course determined by the source
 * grammar file.
